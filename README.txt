What it is:
A reference of radioactive decay data for iOS.

Status:
Complete. In future, I would like to:
- jazz it up with some more pictures
- make iPad version

Details:
This was primarily for me to learn iOS development, as the command line reference I wrote in C is frankly more useful in the lab. Nonetheless, I think this is a passable first app.
